This file should contain the following:

@type @tags

Matching these in the server filter config (not client config)
allows for filter actions to be aggregated on the server. I suspect
some matching should stay on the client Logstash instances, timestamps
perhaps?


Types:

rails-log
utility-log
deploy-log
etl-log
nginx-error-log


Tags:

production-appserver
devopstest-appserver
qa-appserver

production-utility
devopstest-utility
qa-utility

multiline (rails logs, better matched by type though)

timing (etl timings for now)
